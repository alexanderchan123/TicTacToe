# TicTacToe
Multiplayer TicTacToe Project

Clickn on the TicTacToe repository, then fork it (around the top right). Then download the project (green button). Open the project in eclipse, or if that doesn't work just create a new eclipse project and add the tictactoe.java file to your project (you can find the file in the src folder). Then in the main function, write a new print statement, ie System.out.println("Hi my name is Alex"); . Now go back to github upload your update changed to your forked repository. Then click on the create a pull request. Follow the on screen instructions. From there after you submit I will see what changes you made and will merge your code into my master branch. So after that you will have created your first pull request and code commit. This is how we will keep our code in sync with one another.
